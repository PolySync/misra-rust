# MISRA-Rust
An investigation into what adhering to each MISRA-C rule looks like in Rust.
The intention is to decipher how much we "get for free" from the Rust compiler.

### Usage

Each example was written for use with `rustc`.

For example to explore the
MISRA C rule 2.1 in Section 8.2 detailed in the `MISRA-Rules.md`,
run `rustc src/Rule_2_1.rs`.
