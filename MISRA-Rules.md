_No direct corollary in Rust._

__[See Rule_6_2.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_6_2.rs)__

## 8.7 Literals and Constants

### Rule 7.1 🗙

_interchangeable without being explicit._

### Rule 7.4 ✔️

"A string literal shall not be assigned to an object unless the object's type
is a 'pointer to const-qualified _char_'."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust as it doesn't apply in a literal_
_sense. Rust will allow a mutable variable representing a string literal while_
_at the same time disallowing unsafe access or modifications to it._

__[See Rule_7_4.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_7_4.rs)__

## 8.8 Literals and Constants

"An identifier with external linkage shall have exactly one external
definition."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_6.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_6.rs)__

and functions that have internal linkage."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_8.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_8.rs)__

### Rule 8.9 ✔️

"An object should be defined at block scope if its identifier only appears in
a single function." (Don't use globals if a local variable will work instead.)

_No direct corollary in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_9.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_9.rs)__

### Rule 8.10 ✔️

"An _inline_ function shall be declared with the static storage class."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_10.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_10.rs)__

### Rule 8.11 ✔️

"When an array with external linkage is declared, its size should be explicitly
specified."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_11.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_11.rs)__

### Rule 8.12 ✔️

"Within an enumerator list, the value of an implicitly specified enmueration
constnat shall be unique."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_12.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_12.rs)__

### Rule 8.13 🗙

"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible."

_This is not strictly enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_13.rs](./tests/compile-fail/Rule_8_13.rs)__

### Rule 8.14 ✔️
