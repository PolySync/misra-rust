__[See Rule_3_2.rs](./src/Rule_3_2.rs)__

## 8.4 Character sets and lexical conventions

### Rule 4.1

"Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences shall be terminated."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust though ambuguous escapes are not_
_allowed. All ASCII and byte escapes require exactly 2 hexadecimal digits._

### Rule 4.2

"Trigraphs should not be used."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

## 8.5 Identifiers

__[See Rule_5_1.rs](./src/Rule_5_1.rs)__

### Rule 5.2

"Identifiers declared in the same scope and namespace shall be shall be
distinct."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust._

__[See Rule_5_2.rs](./src/Rule_5_2.rs)__

### Rule 5.3

"An identifier declared in an inner scope shall not hide an identifier declared
in an outer scope."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust. Shadowing is allowed._

__[See Rule_5_3.rs](./src/Rule_5_3.rs)__

### Rule 5.4

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust. Shadowing is allowed._

__[See Rule_5_4.rs](./src/Rule_5_4.rs)__

### Rule 5.5

"Identifiers shall be distinct from macro names."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust but macros aren't mistakable as_
_other identifiers in Rust in the same way because of the `!` character_
_requirement. Shadowing is allowed._

__[See Rule_5_5.rs](./src/Rule_5_5.rs)__

### Rule 5.6

__[See Rule_5_7.rs](./src/Rule_5_7.rs)__

### Rule 5.8

"Identifiers that define objects or functions with external linkage shall be
unique."

_Needs more research. This rule may not be strictly enforcable in Rust as_
_shadowing is allowed but the example at least causes a compile error._

__[See Rule_5_8.rs](./src/Rule_5_8.rs)__

### Rule 5.9

"Identifiers that define objects or functions with internal linkage shall be
unique."

_Needs more research. This rule may not be strictly enforcable in Rust as_
_shadowing is allowed but the example at least causes a compile error._

__[See Rule_5_9.rs](./src/Rule_5_9.rs)__

### Rule 6.1

"Bit-fields shall only be declared with an appropriate type."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

### Rule 6.2

"Single-bit named fields shall not be of a signed type."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

## 8.7 Literals and Constants

### Rule 7.1

"Octal constants shall not be used."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust though octal constants are_
_differentiatable from decimal constants because they require the `0o` prefix._

### Rule 7.2

"A "u" or "U" suffix shall be applied to all integer constants that are
represented in an unsigned type.

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, there is no 'U' or 'u' suffix_
_though the language enforces that signed and unsigned types are not_
_interchangeable without being explicit._

__[See Rule_7_2.rs](./src/Rule_7_2.rs)__

### Rule 7.3

"The lowercase 'l' shall not be used in a literal suffix."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, there is no 'L' or 'l' suffix._

### Rule 7.4

"A string literal shall not be assigned to an object unless the object's type
is a 'pointer to const-qualified _char_'."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust as it doesn't apply in a literal_
_sense. Rust will allow a mutable variable representing a string literal while_
_at the same time disallowing unsafe access or modifications to it._

__[See Rule_7_4.rs](./src/Rule_7_4.rs)__

## 8.8 Literals and Constants

### Rule 8.1

"Types shall be explicitly specified."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust as types can be inferred after_
_declaration. It's kind of a non-issue as it's not possible to "mix" types,_
_i.e, if a variable is used as a `u8` it cannot later be used as a `char`_
_without being explicit._

### Rule 8.2

"Function types shall be in prototype form with named parameters."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, there is no concept of the_
_function prototype._

### Rule 8.3

"All declarations of an object or function shall use the same names and type
qualifiers."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, there is no concept of the_
_function prototype._

### Rule 8.4

"A compatible declaration shall be visible when an object or function with
external linkage is defined."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, there is no concept of the_
_forward declaration An external object it may be identified with a 'use'_
_declaration as well as a less explicict wildcard._

### Rule 8.5

"An external object or function shall be declared once in one and only one
file."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, shadowing is allowed, objects_
_and functions are scoped. There can be no more than one declaration per scope._

### Rule 8.6

"An identifier with external linkage shall have exactly one external
definition."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust, shadowing is allowed, objects_
_and functions are scoped. There can be no more than one definition per scope._

### Rule 8.7

"Functions and objects should not be defined with external linkage if they
are referenced in only one translation unit."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust libraries though external_
_visibility in Rust requires explicit "opt-in" with the `pub` keyword._

### Rule 8.8

"The static storage class specifier shall be used in all declarations of objects
and functions that have internal linkage."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust though external visibility in_
_Rust requires explicit "opt-in" with the `pub` keyword rather than the C_
_"out-out" requirement that may me more easily misused._

### Rule 8.9

"An object should be defined at block scope if its identifier only appears in
a single function." (Don't use globals if a local variable will work instead.)

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust._

### Rule 8.10

"An _inline_ function shall be declared with the static storage class."

_This rule is not strictly enforcable in Rust._

### Rule 8.11

"When an array with external linkage is declared, its size should be explicitly
specified."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_11.rs](./src/Rule_8_11.rs)__

### Rule 8.12

"Within an enumerator list, the value of an implicitly specified enmueration
constnat shall be unique."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_12.rs](./src/Rule_8_12.rs)__

### Rule 8.13

"A pointer should point to a const-qualified type whenever possible."

_Const is default in Rust, mutability is "opt-in". If a type isn't used_
_mutably, declaring it as so can be prevented at compile time._

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_8_13.rs](./src/Rule_8_13.rs)__

### Rule 8.14

"The _restrict_ type qualifier shall not be used."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

## 8.9 Initialization

### Rule 9.1

"The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not be read before
it is set."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_9_1.rs](./src/Rule_9_1.rs)__

### Rule 9.2

"The initializer for an aggregate or union shall be enclosed in braces."

_No direct corollary in Rust._

### Rule 9.3

"Arrays shall not be partially initialized."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_9_3.rs](./src/Rule_9_3.rs)__

### Rule 9.4

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_9_4.rs](./src/Rule_9_4.rs)__

### Rule 9.5

"Where designated initializers are used to initialize an array object the size
of the array shall be specified explicitly."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_9_5.rs](./src/Rule_9_5.rs)__

## 8.10 The Essential Type Model

### Rule 10.1

"Operands shall not be of an inappropriate essential type."

_This is not strictly enforceable in Rust. For instance bitwise operations_
_on signed integers are allowed._

### Rule 10.2

"Expressions of essentially character type shall not be used inappropriately
in addition and subtraction operations."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_2.rs](./src/Rule_10_2.rs)__

### Rule 10.3

"The value od an experssionshall not be assigned to an object with a narrower
essential type or of a different essential type category."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_3.rs](./src/Rule_10_3.rs)__

### Rule 10.4

"Both operands of an operator in which the usual arithmetic conversions are
performed shall have the same essential type category."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_4.rs](./src/Rule_10_4.rs)__

### Rule 10.5

"The value of an expression should not be cast to an inappropriate essential
type."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_5.rs](./src/Rule_10_5.rs)__

### Rule 10.6

"The value of a composite expression shall not be assigned to an object
with wider essential type."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_6.rs](./src/Rule_10_6.rs)__

### Rule 10.7

usual arithmetic conversions are performed then the other operand shall not have
wider essential type."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_10_7.rs](./src/Rule_10_7.rs)__

### Rule 10.8

### Rule 11.2

"Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to an incomplete type and
any other type."

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_11_2.rs](./src/Rule_11_2.rs)__

### Rule 11.3

"A cast shall not be performed between a pointer to object type and a pointer
to different object type."

_You may define the `From` trait to facilitate this behavior but by default,_
_this behavior is not allowed for custom types_

_Enforceable in Rust._

__[See Rule_11_3.rs](./src/Rule_11_3.rs)__

### Rule 11.4

"A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object and integer
type."
